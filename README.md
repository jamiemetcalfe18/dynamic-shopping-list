# dynamic-shopping-list
A dynamic shopping list web app utilizing html, css, and vanilla js. 

This is part one of a two part assignment. The purpose of this assingment was to get used to manipulating the DOM. I found it really challenging, and it pushed my limits. I really enjoyed this assignment and I think the DOM is really powerful with the amount of things you can do with it. There is a second part of this assigmnet, and I will write more here after it is finished.
