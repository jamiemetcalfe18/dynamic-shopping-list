# dynamic-shopping-list
A dynamic shopping list web app utilizing html, css, and vanilla js. 

This is part one of a two part assignment. The purpose of this assingment was to get used to manipulating the DOM. I found it really challenging, and it pushed my limits. I really enjoyed this assignment and I think the DOM is really powerful with the amount of things you can do with it. 

For part two, we had to make items on the list persist. This was interesting and challenging to me as I haven't done anything of this nature before. I really enjoyed it. 

Overall this project taught me a lot and I am really proud of it. In the future I might go back and add a counter maybe to add amounts of an item.
